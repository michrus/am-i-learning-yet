    "Linear regression is a method of finding parameters of a linear model to fit the provided input data.\n",
    "The linear model is a straight line mathematically defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = wx + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:<br><br>\n",
    "$y$ - target variable also called dependent variable, \"output\".<br>\n",
    "$x$ - independent variable, \"input\".<br>\n",
    "$w$ - input variable coefficient, learned parameter.<br>\n",
    "$b$ - bias coefficient, learned parameter.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Independent variable (x) doesn't have to be a single scalar value. Linear regression can model relationships between dependent variable (y) and multiple inputs as a sum of input values, each weighted by a coefficient and bias parameter. In this general case the equation for linear model would look like:\n",
