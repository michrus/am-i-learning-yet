    "Is an algorithm for fitting linear model. Given linear model described by equation $ y = wx + b $, it finds the values for $w$ and $b$ such that the model \"fits\" the provided data. Meaning, given input values $x$ it predicts as acurately as possible the values of $y$.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For demonstration, look at the plot below. The blue dots are data points and the red line represents a model that has been fit to that data - it's $w$ and $b$ parameters are such that given linear equation $ y = wx + b $ it correctly predicts $y$ for given input values $x$."
